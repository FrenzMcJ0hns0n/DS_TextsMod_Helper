# DS_TextsMod_Helper

Following the console application [DS-Mod-CompareFmgCsv](https://github.com/FrenzMcJ0hns0n/DS-Mod-CompareFmgCsv)

A modding tool powered by [SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats) to manage texts in Souls games. Designed to compare contents or prepare new mod translations.  
Basically it takes FMG files in input and loops through their text entries to generate new files in output.
