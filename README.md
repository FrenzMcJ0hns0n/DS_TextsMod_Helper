# DS_TextsMod_Helper

Following the console application [DS-Mod-CompareFmgCsv](https://github.com/FrenzMcJ0hns0n/DS-Mod-CompareFmgCsv)

Basically this program takes CSV files in input, then does some operations to generate other and bigger CSV files in output.
But it is designed with a much more specific use in mind : ease the work of translators around text mods for the Souls games.
