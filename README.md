# DS_TextsMod_Helper

A modding tool powered by [SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats) to manage texts in Souls games.  
It takes FMG files in input to process their text entries and generate new files in output.

The program is mainly designed to ease the work of mod translators, with 3 processing modes :
- **Read** : Get the text contents from a file
- **Compare** : Check the differences between 2 files
- **Prepare** : Replicate a mod file structure and use the vanilla files to translate unmodified values

This is not a text editor for FMG files

From top to bottom:
1. Select a mode to process files
2. Drag & drop some FMG input files
3. (Change values of the Options fields)
4. (Check the results with the Output preview)
5. Create new files with button "Generate output file"
